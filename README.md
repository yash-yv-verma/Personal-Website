# yash-verma.com (Personal Website)

This site is being migrated to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for better scalability and maintainability.

## Structure

- `src/pages/` — All routes/pages (e.g., `/`, `/aadra`, `/bts`, `/blog`)
- `src/public/` — Static assets (images, fonts, CSS, JS, etc.)
- `src/styles/` — Global and page-specific CSS

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building for GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```
The static site will be output to the `out/` directory, which can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

---

**All content and appearance are being preserved during migration.**
